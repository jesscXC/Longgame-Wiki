Connect and interweave macro systems to go faster. (eg AutoHotkey, Sublime Text, VS Code, CharaChorder, etc)

Create and organize macros using a programmable language that transpiles to different macro systems.

Macros here are considered as information transformers. The language is programmable in the sense that it is configurable to how you like.
